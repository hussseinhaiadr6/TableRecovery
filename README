## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine. Choose a location for your project directory (`WhateverName` in this example):

```bash
# Create your project directory (e.g., WhateverName)
mkdir WhateverName
cd WhateverName

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hussseinhaiadr6/TableRecovery.git
Setup Virtual Environment
Next, set up a virtual environment using Python 3.9. If you don't have virtualenv installed, install it via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install virtualenv
Create a virtual environment named your_env_name (adjust paths as necessary):

bash
Copy code
virtualenv -p C:/Users/HHR6/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe your_env_name
Activate the Environment
Activate the virtual environment. The path may vary depending on your operating system:

bash
Copy code
# Windows
cd your_env_name\Scripts
activate

# macOS / Linux
source your_env_name/bin/activate
Install Requirements
Navigate to the project directory containing requirements.txt and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd WhateverName/TableRecovery
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Pipeline
Update Input File Path
In the Pipeline.py file, update the input_filename variable to point to your PDF file:

python
Copy code
input_filename = "C:/Users/.../File.pdf"
Run the Pipeline
Once configured, run the pipeline script using Python:

bash
Copy code
cd WhateverName/TableRecovery
python Pipeline.py
This command will execute the pipeline and process your input file.

You can copy and paste this entire block into your README file. This version includes all sections combined in a s

	1.2) this directory will be your path - i will call it:  your_path   should be Something like C:/Users/..../WhateverName
	1.3) run the "git clone  https://github.com/hussseinhaiadr6/TableRecovery.git" to clone the repo
2) virtualenv -p C:/Users/HHR6/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe Something like C:/Users/..../WhateverName
	2.1) you may need to  run pip install virtualenv
	2.2) you need to install python 3.9 version 
	2.3) C:/Users/HHR6/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe  : this is the path to the bin folder of the python 3.9 yours will be different then mine it should look like  C:/Users/.../Python39/python.exe
	2.4) this is the where the file of the virtual environment will be created - Something like C:/Users/..../WhateverName/your_env_name"
3) activate the environment
	3.1) by "cd  C:/Users/..../WhateverName/your_env_name/scripts/activate"
4) run the "cd C:/Users/..../WhateverName/TableRecovery" - this will change the directory to where the requirements folder is located 
	4.1) run the pip install -r requirements.txt
5) got to this directory by running " cd C:/Users/..../WhateverName/TableRecovery" 
	5.1) "git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR.git"
6) int he Pipline.py file 
	change the input_filename = "Path/to/your/PDFfile", 
	shoul look like  "C:/Users/.../File.pdf"
7) "python Pipline.py "
